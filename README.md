# Reliability-of-capacitated-systems-with-performance-sharing-mechanism
Note that calculate.cpp is the implementation of the proposed algorithm put forward in Manuscript â€œReliability-of-capacitated-systems-with-performance-sharing-mechanism
The implementation of algorithm requires compiler c++/g++
Input the data in input.txt and the results will be performed in output.txt after the running of calculate.cpp.
Feel free to contact us if there exist any problem.
